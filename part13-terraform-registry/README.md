Private Registries
The registry at registry.terraform.io only hosts public modules, but most organizations have some modules that can't, shouldn't, or don't need to be public.
You can load private modules directly from version control and other sources, but those sources don't support version constraints or a browsable marketplace of modules, both of which are important for enabling a producers-and-consumers content model in a large organization.
If your organization is specialized enough that teams frequently use modules created by other teams, you will benefit from a private module registry.
